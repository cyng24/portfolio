        <h1>About</h1>
        <text>I'm a designer and developer with a background in architecture and programming. I am always seeking projects that merge all of my skills, creating immersive products that incorporate spatial design and digital media. I've participated in a wide array of hackathons focused on net neutrality to oceanography. I've created projects for mesh networks and VR headsets. I have a growing list of various videos, articles, personal projects, and meetups I tackle everyday, which is one of the reasons I’m so interested in the tech industry. With the growth and development of new products and platforms, I’ll never run out of things to learn.</text>
